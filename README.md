Mission Control

## Notices
* __Please use issue numbers when committing changes/fixes relating to defined issues, it makes everything more trackable__ (also you don't have to be as descriptive, i.e. `Fixed #n` would be easier and as descriptive than `I fixed the issue where everything explodes if you click the middle mouse button`)
* [Tim Time happened](https://github.com/MWUK/Fly-Hard/blob/master/Docs/Tim%20Time/28-2-14.md).
* Super SEPR Saturday Shenanigans _also happened._ 
* Please declare what classes you're working on, for the benefit of others who might be working concurrently, so as to avoid conflicts.
 * Preferably via the table at the bottom.
 * Or by messaging [Mark](http://github.com/MWUK) who'll update the table on your behalf.
* Any issues with the Tasks table, change (if it is independent of others), or raise on Facebook/with dependent individual directly.
* [Mark](https://github.com/MWUK) has started documenting all the [variables](https://github.com/MWUK/Fly-Hard/wiki/Variables) (inc. name changes amongst other info) because he really loathes fun and has developed sudden OCD.
* The repo will be deleted/cleared periodically.
