Mission Control - __Stripping__
========

## Notices
<<<<<<< HEAD

* Due to the fact I hadn't pulled in 10 days, the `iOS7` branch was making me cry, so I gave up and started afresh.
* I will be changing `aircraft.java` in order to better accomodate a flightstrip system.
* Things will get funky.

| Flightstrips | [Saab](http://www.saabgroup.com/Global/Documents%20and%20Images/Civil%20Security/Air%20Transportation%20and%20Airport%20Security/e-Strip/E-Strip-WEB.pdf). | Summer/1 |
| Make the game look less terrible | Less green. | _Eventually_ |
| Merge `stripping` into `master` | I dread this. | _Even more eventually_ |


## Notes

* Features/elements may come and go in this branch.
 * Have a nose, but please don't touch (too much/without asking)
 * Feel free to correct/ridicule my decisions (but try to warn me before any attempts to merge, I'll warn you all however).
 * __Don't panic!__


## Scratchpad

* I'm going to try different themes/styles.
 * In particular, I'm curious to try multiple colours per player (although on a theme per player to avoid confusion.)
* Flightstrips are first priority.
* I'll update what's being remoulded when I arrive at it (or am closer to it).
