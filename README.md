## Announcement

The final __SEPR Team Time__ of Stage 2 is due to be held on 8 June, at a time to be confirmed, as is convenient for everyone.

This will be an opportunity to raise any concerns, wishes, or general thoughts over how and what to do with GOA and Fly-Hard (particularly concerning investing in it and developing it further).
