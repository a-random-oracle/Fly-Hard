## Notes

* `.classpath`s might be a little weird. Check yourself before you wreck yourself.
* camelCase is ongoing.
* Ladbrokes has odds on 2/1 for the new requirement being 3D rendering, 3/2 on it being missions, 12/1 on procedural generation, and 19/4 on GTA-style bonus game whereby you can get out of your plane and roam a 3D airport.
